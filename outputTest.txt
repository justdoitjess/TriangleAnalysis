This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: 8

Enter the second side length: 4

Enter the third side length: 11
Triangle created with side lengths: 8, 4, 11

Those sides form a scalene triangle


Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): y


This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: 24

Enter the second side length: 24

Enter the third side length: 10
Triangle created with side lengths: 24, 24, 10

Those sides form an isoscelese triangle


Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): y


This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: 3

Enter the second side length: 3

Enter the third side length: 3
Triangle created with side lengths: 3, 3, 3

Those sides form an equilateral triangle


Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): y


This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: a
Bad value!Try again.
2

Enter the second side length: a5d
Bad value!Try again.
7

Enter the third side length: 7.1
Triangle created with side lengths: 2, 7, 7

Those sides form an isoscelese triangle


Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): y


This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: 27

Enter the second side length: 1

Enter the third side length: 2


Sides: 27, 1, 2--Those lengths do not define a triangle. Start Over.




Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): y


This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: -5

Enter the second side length: 0

Enter the third side length: 7


Sides: -5, 0, 7--Those lengths do not define a triangle. Start Over.




Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): y


This program will evaluate three integers that make up a triangle.
**Any decimal values or extraneous input will be truncated**
Enter the first side length: 4ww5

Enter the second side length: 3

Enter the third side length: 5
Triangle created with side lengths: 4, 3, 5

Those sides form a scalene triangle


Do you wish to enter another set of side lengths? (Y or N): n
